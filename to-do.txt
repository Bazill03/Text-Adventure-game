General Issues:
-------
It is possible to receive an item twice.
Much smoother transitions between combat and dialogue.
[Copied from other to-do list to be organized at a later date.]
//TODO Add strong tags to items that can be taken. Work on clarity.
//TODO convert usefireball and useweapon into single function
//TODO Impliment ice shard and mana potions
//TODO if visted room before, different text & find way to change room entrance if player has spoken to actor
//TODO streamline navigation
//TODO FEATURE Idea: read books
------

Room 2:
-------
Old note in room 2 not being pushed to look list. Player is still able to read the note, but would have no idea how to.
Upon entering room 2 an "undefined" message is displayed.
-------

Room 5[Grand Hall]:
Int description doesn't drive home very well just how many birds be slammin that door.

Room 6[Ornate Chambers]:
------
Frantic Cultist needs a 'look' description.
Frantic Cultist should have another dialogue when spoken to after finding vial.
looking at small antechamber does not change after ghoul defeated.
Frantic Cultists dialogue ends prematurely.
------

Combat:
------
Combat need an overhaul.
  1. Boring
  2. Action is unclear. 
Enemy health likes to perch itself in the title to get a better view of the action.
If player is dealt negative damage because of armor, the damage should be changed to 0. Or 1. Or 2. Haven't decided.
-------

General Browser woes:
------
Firefox: Title is broken. [The character encoding of the HTML document was not declared. The document will render with garbled text in some browser configurations if the document contains characters from outside the US-ASCII range. The character encoding of the page must be declared in the document or in the transfer protocol.]
------

Ideas:
------
Text should have a border so some kind to more easily differentiante different descriptions.
Text spoken to the player should have another text color.
Look description should have another color for doors not yet entered. [May be difficult to implement.]
A list of available commands appears on the right side of the screen. [Could be very difficult to implement.]
A list of the players inventory on the left side of the screen. [Could be easy to implement.]
------

Pipe Dreams:
-----
Level system with speech and str checks.[This would actually make speech and the "trial of the shardkeeper" much more interesting.]
-----

Fixed:

  Speak not working [requires web server otherwise pulling the dialogue file will be an invalid CORS request]
